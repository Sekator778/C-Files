# C Piscine Solutions - 42 Berlin

![Repository](https://github.com/Sekator778/C-Files)  
**Author**: Sekator778  
**School**: [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/de/)

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the **C Piscine** from [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/de/). The **C Piscine** is an intensive programming bootcamp designed to teach the fundamentals of C programming and other essential programming concepts. Each folder in this repository represents a different stage of the curriculum, organized by exercises and rush projects.

### Folder Structure

- **C00 - C11**: These folders contain exercises and tasks designed to introduce key programming concepts, ranging from basic C syntax to more advanced topics like memory management and file I/O.
- **rush01, rush02**: Larger, team-based projects focused on practical problem-solving and real-world applications.
- **src**: Various source code files from different projects.

### Curriculum Highlights

- **C00 - C05**: Introduction to basic C programming, loops, conditions, arrays, and basic functions.
- **C06 - C09**: Dive into more advanced topics such as memory management, pointers, and dynamic allocation.
- **C11**: Advanced concepts, including file handling, linked lists, and custom data structures.
- **Rush Projects**: Collaborative coding projects to simulate real-world software development, focusing on teamwork and problem-solving.

### Projects

1. **C Piscine Exercises**: 
    - These are smaller exercises that build fundamental programming skills.
    - Examples: Implementing standard C functions like `ft_strdup`, `ft_strcat`, `ft_strstr`, and more.
    
2. **Rush Projects**:
    - Larger projects designed to be completed in a team setting.
    - Examples: Custom parsers, logic problems, and interactive programs.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sekator778/C-Files.git
    ```

2. Navigate to any specific folder (e.g., `C05`), and run the exercises:
    ```bash
    cd C05
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror <exercise_file.c> -o output
    ./output
    ```

### Why 42 Berlin?

**42 Berlin** is a cutting-edge coding school with a peer-to-peer learning model that fosters creativity, collaboration, and hands-on problem-solving. The C Piscine is the foundation of the school's curriculum, challenging students to think algorithmically and work collaboratively.
